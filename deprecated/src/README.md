Please be noticed that the conn.php would be the information about one's database, if one needs to run the code from localhost,
please add the details for your reference.

sendmail.php and sendresultmail.php would require gmail account and its app password for the automation of mail sent,
please add and amend the details for your reference.

All php that needs to connect with the conn.php would need amendment on the root "/testwsqlnew/..." to be your own filename "/<newname>/..." 
which the files should be kept in your web server.

If one needs to view the code not in localhost perception but in school's intranet perception,
please view the public_html in "webhome" directory, the link has been given in the final report,
